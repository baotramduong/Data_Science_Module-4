    "# Context-Free Grammars - Codealong\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll write our own **_Context-Free Grammar_** (CFG) to provide a parser with rules for how sentences can be parsed. We'll also explore how we can easily obtain **_Part-of-Speech (POS) Tags_** using NLTK!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use NLTK to create context-free grammar and part-of-speech (POS) tags  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating A Context-Free Grammar\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we'll do in this lab is create our own CFG and use it to parse a sentence. The goal of this is to help us better understand the **_recursive_** nature of context-free grammars. By definition, these grammars have to be recursive, because valid sentences can contain other smaller, valid sentences. Consider the following example, pulled from the NLTK book's chapter on Analyzing Sentence Structure. We've highlighted the top-level verb phrase in each sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "a.\t\tUsain Bolt **broke the 100m record**\n",
    "\n",
    "b.\t\tThe Jamaica Observer **reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record**\n",
    "\n",
    "c.\t\tAndre **said The Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record**\n",
    "\n",
    "d.\t\tI **think Andre said the Jamaica Observer reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record**\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we notice?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples above, each sentence is easily recognizable as being grammatically valid. And yet, we can see that sentence 'd' contains three other possible valid sentences. This is because of the recursive structure of grammar. Recall that a sentence (S) is made up of a Noun Phrase (NP) and a Verb Phrase (VP). This gets interesting when we realize that both NPs and VPs are allowed to be made up of other NPs and VPs! In each of the sentences above, we can see that the smaller sentences are just constituent pieces of the top-level Verb Phrase. For example, in sentence _b_, the top-level Noun Phrase is \"The Jamaica Observer\". The top-level Verb Phrase is 'reported that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record'. However, this Verb Phrase can be broken down into a verb 'reported', and a noun phrase 'that Usain Bolt broke the 100m record.' This noun phrase can itself be broken down into the smaller, valid parse tree from the first sentence, with 'Usain Bolt' as a noun phrase, and 'broke the 100m record' as a verb phrase. All this recursion can be a bit confusing! Luckily, computers are really, really good at it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To really drive this point home about sentences being made up of recursive units of words, take a look at the following diagram (also from the NLTK ch. 8 provided above):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/cfg_diagram.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram shows the various valid combinations words from the sentences \"He ran\" and \"The little bear saw the fine fat trout in the brook\". As we can see from the diagram, as long as we're switching out grammatical units that are the same type (e.g. a noun phrase for a noun phrase), the result is a completely valid sentence -- both \"the little bear saw the fine fat trout in the brook\" and \"he saw the fine fat trout in the brook\" are grammatically correct. This means that we don't actually need to care what the actual words are -- just their grammatical part of speech! \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen some examples, let's get to creating our own CFG and using it to create a parse tree!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating a CFG \n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK makes it extremely easy to generate a CFG by providing a helper function. Here's the example we saw in the last lesson, which was also pulled from the NLTK book in chapter 8:"

    "\n",
    "Let's start from the beginning. We see that our noun phrase consists only of a noun (N). This means that we've found the first problem -- we haven't defined a rule in the NP section of our grammar that says that's allowed! \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we need to change our grammar's NP line from `NP -> NP -> Det N | Det N PP ` to `NP -> Det N | Det N PP | N `, thereby providing a rule that says that single nouns (N) are allowed to act as a valid noun phrase. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving onto our verb phrase, we see that our verb phrase consists of a verb and a noun phrase. If we look at the first rule for verb phrases, `VP -> V NP`, we can see that this is already explicitly covered. Since the verb portion of phrase is fine, this means the error lies in the NP portion of our VP. We can see that the structure of this NP is `Det Adj N`, which our NP rules do not currently allow for. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can fix this by modifying our NP phrase in a few ways. We can modify it by simply adding `Det Adj N` as a case for our NP rules, and not use any recursion. This is a valid way to fix it, but with large grammars, the number of rules we write will go through the roof, since we're treating each possible combination as a special case. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use recursion to fix this. Let's define what we need to add to get this working:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Noun Phrases (NP) need to be able to consist of `Det` followed by a Noun Phrase `NP`. \n",
    "* Noun Phrases need to be able to consist of `Adj` followed by an `N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we can get a bit clever. To solve the first point, we need to add a rule that says that a Noun Phrase (NP) can be a Det followed by a Noun Phrase, NP -- `Det NP` will work to solve this.  Note that if we add this line in, the first rule that explicitly spells out `Det N` becomes redundant. Since our recursive structure will catch these sorts of cases, we no longer need to explicitly spell it out. This means we can remove it to increase our performance a little bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the second point, we can also use recursion. Since we have already defined that single nouns (N) are a valid form of a noun phrase, we can chain this together with adjectives by adding the rule `Adj NP`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we need to add these rules to the `NP ->` line in our grammar, with each one separated by a `|` (with a space on each side). \n",

    "It worked! But why are there so many trees? Because as our rules stand, there are multiple valid interpretations of the sentence.  This is because we have some empty things like `PP -> P NP` that don't currently have rules, so they're triggering as false positives. \n",

However, this strategy obviously doesn't scale well to the real world -- it would take way too long to label every possible word with a part of speech, and generate every rule possible for a CFG. Luckily, the linguists and programmers have provided a quick and easy way to have this done for us, thanks to the **_Penn Tree Bank_**! The [Penn Tree Bank](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/docs/LDC95T7/cl93.html) is \"a large annotated corpus of English\", according to the researchers at Penn that created it. This means that it already has a ton of well-labeled examples for POS tagging. For us, this means that we can easily use NLTK to generate POS tags for our corpora, without having to worry about hand labeling or generating parse trees. \n",

    "#### Generating and Using POS Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "POS tags are often used as a feature in text datasets. For tasks such as language generation, they are absolutely indispensable, as they allow us to generate sentences from words that are grammatically correct. POS tags can also be useful as feature for things such as text classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generating POS tags is very simple with NLTK -- all we need to do is pass in a tokenized version of our corpus and NLTK will return a list of tuples containing the token and it's part of speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the abbreviations NLTK uses for their POS tags come from the Penn Tree Bank, and won't be immediately recognizable to you. To understand what these tags stand for, take a look at this [reference list].(https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html)\n",

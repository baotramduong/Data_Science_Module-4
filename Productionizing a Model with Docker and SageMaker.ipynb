    "# Productionizing a Model with Docker and SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this codealong, you'll see an example of the steps needed in order to productionize your own model with AWS SageMaker. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a lot of _boilerplate code_ provided by Amazon which you'll need to make use of pretty much anytime you need to productionize a model. Much of this can be copied and pasted over, although it's likely that some modifications will be needed on a project-by-project basis. Going forward, use this notebook as a reference to remember the necessary steps for productionizing a model with AWS SageMaker -- you are _not_ expected to remember or even understand most of the code in this notebook, as you aren't yet familiar with AWS and its quirks. That's okay -- notebooks like these are meant to help you through productionizing a model until you've done it a few times and start to understand the process and the necessary code needed to make it all work!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook borrows it's general structure, as well as all boilerplate code, from this [training repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-keras-text-classification) provided publicly by AWS. For more examples of how to use various AWS services, check out the [AWS-Samples Repository](https://github.com/aws-samples)!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Process\n",
    "\n",
    "When productionizing a machine learning model using AWS, you'll typically use the following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore and preprocess data\n",
    "2. Build SageMaker container (Docker)\n",
    "3. Test training and inference code on your local machine \n",
    "4. Train and deploy model with SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "To help simplify this process, AWS has provided some example repos containing tutorials and boilerplate code that we will make use of to help us through this process. Any code found in this notebook is primarily concerned with Step 4, training and deploying the model to SageMaker. However, the code in this notebook will only work if you have worked through the sample labs provided by AWS for steps 1 - 3, which will help you gain familiarity working with the platform. You'll find the link to these sample labs below. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 0: Complete Lead-Up Notebooks from AWS Training Team\n",
    "\n",
    "**_IMPORTANT:_** Before beginning on this lab, you need to complete labs 1, 2, and 3 from this [AWS Training Repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-keras-text-classification). Read them thoroughly, and complete each step for each lab. These labs handle much of the basic setup needed in order to make sure the code in this notebook will work, so **_do not skip them!_**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed those labs, come back here and move on to Step 1 below. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Building and Registering the Container\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are at the `container` folder within this repo, you'll see it contains some Docker images. These are docker images that you'll need to make sure you use in your own projects when productionizing a model on AWS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in the cell below is boilerplate code that uses the `container` folder in order to create and register the docker image needed on AWS. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it is best that you upload this notebook in your Jupyter's instance of SageMaker in order to run the following cells!\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have successfully uploaded this notebook, if you are asked to choose a kernel, use the same kernel which runs the `sagemaker_keras_text_classification.ipynb` notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: If you deactivated this process (stopped your Jupyter instance, like _Step 8_ below) and then came back to continue, you'll need to go back and start from [Lab 2](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-keras-text-classification#lab-2-building-the-sagemaker-tensorflow-container), because you need the Docker instance running in order to run the following cells.

While the AWS Free Tier we've signed up for allows us to do small things for free for prototyping or learning, leaving some things running may take us past the usage limits for the AWS Free Tier.

    "As you've seen from this lab, getting a handle on all the different services in AWS and how they interact with one another can be a bit daunting until you have some experience. It's very important that you don't leave services running when you aren't using them, because you will be charged for that. If you want to make sure that you haven't left anything running, the easiest thing to do is to check the 'Costs Explorer' page inside AWS. You can find this by searching for 'AWS Cost Explorer' in the search bar on the main page for the AWS Console. This service will show you what your usage is for everything that you can be charged for. It's quite intuitive and easy to use, and should make it easy to see if you are accruing charges because you left something running that you didn't realize. If you left something running that you aren't aware of, you'll see it here -- once you've noticed it, just navigate to the service in question and deactivate it. \n",

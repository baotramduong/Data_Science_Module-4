        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, we will implement a movie recommendation system using ALS in Spark programming environment. Spark's machine learning library `ml` comes packaged with a very efficient implementation of the ALS algorithm that we looked at in the previous lesson. The lab will require you to put into practice your Spark programming skills for creating and manipulating PySpark DataFrames. We will go through a step-by-step process into developing a movie recommendation system using ALS and PySpark using the `MovieLens` dataset that we used in a previous lab.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: You are advised to refer to [PySpark documentation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/python/index.html) heavily for completing this lab as it will introduce a few new methods. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab you will: \n",
        "\n",
        "- Use Spark to train and cross-validate an ALS model \n",
        "- Introduce a new user with rating to a rating matrix and make recommendations for them \n",
        "- Create a function that will return the top n recommendations for a user "

        "\n",
        "We have seen how recommendation systems have played an integral part in the success of Amazon (books, items), Pandora/Spotify (music), Google (news, search), YouTube (videos) etc.  For Amazon, these systems bring more than 30% of their total revenue. For Netflix, 75% of movies that people watch are based on some sort of recommendation.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The goal of recommendation systems is to find what is likely to be of interest to the user. This enables organizations to offer a high level of personalization and customer tailored services.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For online video content services like Netflix and Hulu, the need to build robust movie recommendation systems is extremely important. An example of a recommendation system is such as this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.    User A watches Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad \n",
        "2.    User B performs a search query for Game of Thrones \n",
        "3.    The system suggests Breaking Bad to user B from data collected about user A \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This lab will guide you through a step-by-step process into developing such a movie recommendation system. We will use the `MovieLens` dataset to build a movie recommendation system using the collaborative filtering technique with Spark's Alternating Least Squares implementation. After building that recommendation system, we will go through the process of adding a new user to the dataset with some new ratings and obtaining new recommendations for that user.\n",

You looked at how Spark's ALS implementation can be used to build a scalable and efficient recommendation system. You also saw that such systems can become computationally expensive and using them with an online system could be a problem with traditional computational platforms. Spark's distributed computing architecture provides a great solution to deploy such recommendation systems for real-world applications (think Amazon, Spotify)."
